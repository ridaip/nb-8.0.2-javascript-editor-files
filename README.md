Netbeans 8.0.2 javascript editor jar files
==========================================

Netbeans 8.0.2 after latest update start scan projects forever with CPU load at 25%.

In this repo I place files from prev release 8.0.2 before last update (2015-03-08). When you replace new files in netbens modules ```NetBeans 8.0.2\ide\modules``` with files from this repository than project scaning start to work correct.

For mor info please see this [steckoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28811246/netbeans-background-scanning-projects-takes-too-long) thread.
